          Hello! I am a Chicago based Software Developer and Video Artist who is passionate about eloquent programs and intuitive interfaces. With a diverse background in New Media Art and past experience working as a museum curator, I bring a variety of approaches to solving problems creatively and efficiently with code.
      <br /> I thrive in team structured environments where collaboration is the key to success. I am detail oriented and believe even the smallest components have a big picture impact. Overall my interests lie at the intersection of art, humans, and the world wide web.
